&lt;p>Welcome to this blog&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hello friends and family who find your way here. I don’t think I need to introduce myself — most of you probably know me already.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But I do want to explain briefly why I decided to start this blog. There are a few reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One is that I’ve seen how useful it can be to share this kind of information. I’ve had several nice coincidences that started with someone posting something on social media — like finding out we’re in the same place by chance. For example, if I share that I’m in Oaxaca or somewhere else, someone I know might be nearby and we can meet. This blog isn’t meant to be a place for constant updates, but I’d like to use it to share the more important changes in my life — in case those nice encounters can happen.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
