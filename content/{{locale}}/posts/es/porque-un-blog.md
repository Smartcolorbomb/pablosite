Hello friends and family who find your way here. I don’t think I need to introduce myself — most of you probably know me already.

But I do want to explain briefly why I decided to start this blog. There are a few reasons:

One is that I’ve seen how useful it can be to share this kind of information. I’ve had several nice coincidences that started with someone posting something on social media — like finding out we’re in the same place by chance. For example, if I share that I’m in Oaxaca or somewhere else, someone I know might be nearby and we can meet. This blog isn’t meant to be a place for constant updates, but I’d like to use it to share the more important changes in my life — in case those nice encounters can happen.

Another reason is personal: I see this as a writing exercise. I’ve always felt I’m not very good at organizing my thoughts or expressing them clearly. I can already tell while writing this — my ideas jump around. I hope to get better with practice. For the public posts, I’ll use AI tools to help me write more clearly, but I’ll also keep the raw drafts to track how my writing improves over time.

I also wanted to learn more about web development. It took me a few days to get this blog online. It’s hosted on GitHub, published through Netlify and managed with Decap CMS. Even though it’s simple, I had to figure out quite a few things — and I learned a lot.

Lastly, I think it’s valuable to have a small personal presence online that doesn’t depend on big platforms. Something static that won’t disappear if Meta or Google change their policies. That’s why I like hosting my own domain — pablo.spa — and using open-source tools. Everything is free for now except the domain, and I’m pretty happy to have it.

So, that’s a small personal justification for this blog. Big hugs to anyone who took the time to read it. In the next post, I’ll try to share a clearer update of where I am and what I’m doing — just in case you’re somewhere nearby.

Take care!
