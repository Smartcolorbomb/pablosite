Hi there!

This page is meant to be a quick snapshot of where I am right now, what I’m doing, and how to reach me — kind of a digital “check-in” for friends, family, or anyone curious.

I'm currently living in a mountain cabin in the Swiss Alps — the [Gaffia Hütte](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3rp6uyCyBACvAzSC9), with the nearest town being Sargans.

During the summer season, I'm working as a waiter at the [Pizolhütte](https://maps.app.goo.gl/L4Kf84GFvuPcFHy69), a mountain hut at the top of the Pizol area. Between shifts, I enjoy the peaceful alpine life and continue doing occasional programming work and digital projects.

Before this, I spent over two years working in my family's woodworking business, *Carpintería Huayapam*, in Oaxaca, Mexico — focused on high-end custom furniture and process improvement.
