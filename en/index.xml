&lt;p>Hello friends and family who find your way here. I don’t think I need to introduce myself — most of you probably know me already.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But I do want to explain briefly why I decided to start this blog. There are a few reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One is that I’ve seen how useful it can be to share this kind of information. I’ve had several nice coincidences that started with someone posting something on social media — like finding out we’re in the same place by chance. For example, if I share that I’m in Oaxaca or somewhere else, someone I know might be nearby and we can meet. This blog isn’t meant to be a place for constant updates, but I’d like to use it to share the more important changes in my life — in case those nice encounters can happen.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Now</title><link>https://pablo.spa/en/now/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pablo.spa/en/now/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img alt="Profile picture" loading="lazy" src="https://pablo.spa/uploads/profile750.jpg">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hi!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This page is a kind of digital check-in where I share where I am, what I’m up to, and how to get in touch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Right now, I’m living in a mountain cabin in the Swiss Alps called &lt;a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/3rp6uyCyBACvAzSC9">Gaffiahütte&lt;/a>, near the town of Sargans.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ll be here until the end of October, working as a waiter and helping with general tasks at the &lt;a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/L4Kf84GFvuPcFHy69">Pizolhütte&lt;/a>, a hut at the top of the mountain. It’s a mix between work and vacation — a job that feels rewarding, low-stress, and fun. It’s giving me the chance to live in this beautiful place and enjoy the Alps for an extended time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Admin</title><link>https://pablo.spa/en/admin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pablo.spa/en/admin/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
