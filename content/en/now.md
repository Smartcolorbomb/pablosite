Hi!

This page is a kind of digital check-in where I share where I am, what I’m up to, and how to get in touch.

Right now, I’m living in a mountain cabin in the Swiss Alps called [Gaffiahütte](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3rp6uyCyBACvAzSC9), near the town of Sargans.

I’ll be here until the end of October, working as a waiter and helping with general tasks at the [Pizolhütte](https://maps.app.goo.gl/L4Kf84GFvuPcFHy69), a hut at the top of the mountain. It’s a mix between work and vacation — a job that feels rewarding, low-stress, and fun. It’s giving me the chance to live in this beautiful place and enjoy the Alps for an extended time.

At night, I also collaborate remotely with [Carpintería Huayapam](https://carpinteriahuayapam.com), my family’s custom furniture workshop in Oaxaca, where I worked for over two years. I still help out with the website and other digital projects from up here.

If you’re nearby, feel free to reach out and maybe we can meet. There’s space for visitors in the hut where I’m staying. Getting here isn’t super easy — you either hike for about three hours or take the gondola — but once you’re here, there’s good food, a warm bed, and amazing views. You’re very welcome!
